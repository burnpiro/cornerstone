\n\n\nCornerstone\n\nCornerstone is an open source project with a goal to deliver a complete web based medical imaging platform.\n\nThis documentation focuses on Cornerstone Core, which is a lightweight JavaScript library for displaying medical images in modern web browsers that support the HTML5 canvas element. Cornerstone Core is not meant to be a complete application itself, but rather a component that can be used as part of larger, more complex applications.\nWhile this documentation grows, the old GitHub wiki may be a better source.\nRelease Notes\nThis wiki is intended to be used as a reference for the concepts and APIs in Cornerstone. If you are new to Cornerstone, we recommend that you start by reviewing the concepts below and then looking at the various examples to see how Cornerstone is used.\n\nInstallation\nConcepts\nEnabled Elements\nImage Ids\nImage Loaders\nViewports\nImages\nPixel Coordinate System\nRendering Loop\nLibraries\nRendering Pipeline\nMetadata Providers\n\n\nAdvanced\nImage Cache\nEnabled Element Layers\nModality LUT and VOI LUT\nColor Lookup Tables\nWebGL Rendering Pipeline\nRetrieving Pixel Data\nLegacy Browser Support\n\n\nIntegration With React\nLive Examples\nAPI\nContributing\nDeveloper Guide\n\n"},"installation.html":{"url":"installation.html","title":"Installation","summary":"Cornerstone installation guide - How to use Cornerstone in your project.","keywords":"","body":"Installation\nDirect Download / CDN\nhttps://unpkg.com/cornerstone-core\n\nUnpkg.com provides NPM-based CDN links.

This strategy allows Cornerstone to simultaneously display multiple images obtained with different protocols from different servers. For example, Cornerstone could display a DICOM CT image obtained via WADO alongside a JPEG dermatology image captured by a digital camera and stored on a file system.\nThe Image Id format\n\nCornerstone does not specify what the contents of the URL are - it is up to the Image Loader to define the contents and format of the URL so that it can locate the image. For example, a proprietary Image Loader plugin could be written to talk to a proprietary server and lookup images using a GUID, filename or database row id.\nHere are some examples of what an Image Id could look like for different Image Loader plugins:\n\nexample://1\ndicomweb://server/wado/{uid}/{uid}/{uid}\nhttp://server/image.jpeg\ncustom://server/uuid\n\n"},"concepts/image-loaders.html":{"url":"concepts/image-loaders.html","title":"Image Loaders","summary":"Cornerstone allows developers to define their own Image Loaders to create Images for display and manipulation.","keywords":"","body":"Image Loaders\n\nAn Image Loader is a JavaScript function that is responsible for taking an Image Id for an Image and returning the corresponding Image Load Object for that Image to Cornerstone. The Image Load Object contains a Promise which resolves to produce an Image.\n\nSince loading images usually requires a call to a server, the API for image loading needs to be asynchronous. Cornerstone requires that Image Loaders return an Object containing a Promise which Cornerstone will use to receive the Image Object asynchronously, or an Error if one has occurred.\nImage Loader Workflow\n\n\nImageLoaders register themselves with cornerstone to load specific ImageId URL schemes\nThe application requests to load an image using the loadImage() api.\nCornerstone delegates the request to load the image to the ImageLoader registered with the URL scheme of the imageId passed to loadImage().\nThe ImageLoader will return an Image Load Object containing a Promise which it will resolve with the corresponding Image Object once it has obtained the pixel data. Obtaining the pixel data may require a call to a remote server using XMLHttpRequest, decompression of the pixel data (e.g. from JPEG 2000), and conversion of the pixel data into the format that Cornerstone understands (e.g. RGB vs YBR color).\nThe Image Object passed back by the resolved Promise is then displayed using the displayImage() API.\n\nWhile pixel data is usually obtained from a server, this doesn't always have to be the case. The live examples actually use an ImageLoader plugin to serve up images without requiring a server at all.  In this case, the images are base64 encoded and stored in the ImageLoader plugin itself. The plugin simply converts the base64 pixel data into an array of pixels. Alternatively, one could write an image loader that generates derived images on the client side. For example, you could implement MPR functionality this way.\nAvailable Image Loaders\n\n\n\nImage Loader\nUsed for\n\n\n\n\nCornerstone WADO Image Loader\nDICOM Part 10 images Supports WADO-URI and WADO-RS Supports multi-frame DICOM instances Supports reading DICOM files from the File objects\n\n\nCornerstone Web Image Loader\nPNG and JPEG images\n\n\n\nFeel free to send a Pull Request if you have an Image Loader you want to add to this list.\nImage Load Object\nCornerstone Image Loaders return Image Load Objects which contain a Promise. The reason we have chosen to use an Object instead of solely returning a Promise is because now Image Loaders can also return other properties in their Image Load Objects. As an example, we intend to implement support for cancelling pending or ongoing requests using a cancelFn passed back by an Image Loader within an Image Load Object. This is still in development, however.\nWriting an Image Loader\nHere is an example of an Image Loader that fetches pixel data using XMLHttpRequest and return an Image Load Object containing a Promise to Cornerstone:\nfunction loadImage(imageId) {\n    // Parse the imageId and return a usable URL (logic omitted)\n    const url = parseImageId(imageId);\n\n    // Create a new Promise\n    const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      // Inside the Promise Constructor, make\n      // the request for the DICOM data\n      const oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();\n      oReq.open(\"get\", url, true);\n      oReq.responseType = \"arraybuffer\";\n      oReq.onreadystatechange = function(oEvent) {\n          if (oReq.readyState === 4) {\n              if (oReq.status == 200) {\n                  // Request succeeded, Create an image object (logic omitted)\n                  const image = createImageObject(oReq.response);\n\n                  // Return the image object by resolving the Promise\n                  resolve(image);\n              } else {\n                  // An error occurred, return an object containing the error by\n                  // rejecting the Promise\n                  reject(new Error(oReq.statusText));\n              }\n          }\n      };\n\n      oReq.send();\n    });\n\n    // Return an object containing the Promise to cornerstone so it can setup callbacks to be\n    // invoked asynchronously for the success/resolve and failure/reject scenarios.\n    return {\n      promise\n    };\n}\n\nAn Image Loader is responsible for returning an Image Load Object corresponding to the Image Id Cornerstone passed to its loadImage function. When the Promise in the Image Load Object is resolved, it should be resolved with an Image. Image Loaders register themselves for a given URL scheme using the registerImageLoader() API:\n// Register the url scheme 'myCustomLoader' to correspond to our loadImage function\ncornerstone.registerImageLoader('myCustomLoader', loadImage);\n\n// Images loaded as follows will be passed to our loadImage function:\ncornerstone.loadImage('myCustomLoader://example.com/image.dcm')\n\n"},"concepts/viewports.html":{"url":"concepts/viewports.html","title":"Viewports","summary":"Each Enabled Element has a Viewport which describes how the Image should be rendered.","keywords":"","body":"Viewports\n\nEach Enabled Element has a Viewport which describes how the Image should be rendered.\n\nThe viewport parameters for an enabled element can be obtained via the getViewport() function and set using the setViewport() function.

Users can define their own provider functions in order to return any metadata they wish for each specific image.\n\nMedical images typically come with lots of non-pixel-wise metadata such as for example, the pixel spacing of the image, the patient ID, or the scan acquisition date. With some file types (e.g. DICOM), this information is stored within the file header and can be read and parsed and passed around your application. With others (e.g. JPEG, PNG), this information needs to be provided independently from the actual pixel data. Even for DICOM images, however, it is common for application developers to provide metadata independently from the transmission of pixel data from the server to the client since this can considerably improve performance.\nTo handle these scenarios, Cornerstone provides infrastructure for the definition and usage of Metadata Providers. Metadata Providers are simply functions which take in an Image Id and specified metadata type, and return the metadata itself.\nHere is a simple example of a Metadata Provider which returns an Object containing Image Plane metadata for a single specific image (Image Id: 'ct://1'):\nfunction metaDataProvider(type, imageId) {\n  if (type === 'imagePlaneModule') {\n    if (imageId === 'ct://1') {\n        return {\n            frameOfReferenceUID: \"1.3.6.1.4.1.5962.99.1.2237260787.1662717184.1234892907507.1411.0\",\n            rows: 512,\n            columns: 512,\n            rowCosines: {\n                x: 1,\n                y: 0,\n                z: 0\n            },\n            columnCosines: {\n                x: 0,\n                y: 1,\n                z: 0\n            },\n            imagePositionPatient: {\n                x: -250,\n                y: -250,\n                z: -399.100006\n            },\n            rowPixelSpacing: 0.976562,\n            columnPixelSpacing: 0.976562\n        };\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Register this provider with CornerstoneJS\ncornerstone.metaData.addProvider(metaDataProvider);\n\n// Retrieve this metaData\nvar imagePlaneModule = cornerstone.metaData.get('imagePlaneModule', 'ct://1');\n\nBasics\n\nCornerstone allows for the registration of multiple Metadata Providers.\nEach provider can provide whichever information the developer desires.\nWhen a request is made for metadata for an image, Cornerstone will iterate through the known providers until it retrieves a defined set of metadata for the specified metadata type.\nProviders can be added to Cornerstone with an optional priority value in order to influence the order in which they are called.\nWhen DICOM images are loaded by Cornerstone WADO Image Loader, their metadata will be parsed and added to a metadata provider automatically.\nWithin Cornerstone Tools, specific metadata types are used to provide metadata for tools.\n\n"},"advanced/image-cache.html":{"url":"advanced/image-cache.html","title":"Image Cache","summary":"Cornerstone stores Images inside the Image Cache to keep track of memory usage.","keywords":"","body":"Image Cache\n\nCornerstone stores Images inside the Image Cache to keep track of memory usage.\n\nWhen the Promise within an Image Load Object resolves, the resulting Image is stored in an Object in the Image Cache module by Cornerstone.

Once you have Node.js and the npm package manager installed, you can use them to install the dependencies for the project and run common development tasks.\nCommon Tasks\nInstalling dependencies\n  npm install\n\nNote: Installing/updating dependencies should be performed after every update from the git repository. If this is not performed, you may run into issues during development.\nRunning the build\n  npm start\n\nRunning the build will create both the minified and un-minified versions of the library, as well as their associated source maps.\nAutomatically running the build after each source change\n  npm run watch\n\nThis command can be used if you want to debug issues or add new features to the source code.\nServing files for development\nThere are many ways of running simple HTTP servers. This is just one method, you can also use e.g. 'python -m simplehttpserver 8080'.\n\nInstall the 'http-server' package:\nnpm install http-server -g\n\nNote: you may need to use sudo to install globally\n\nRun the server\nhttp-server\n\n\nNavigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/example/index.html to load the examples in a browser.\n\nNote: If you want to use them on a mobile device, start the HTTP server and navigate to the IP of your computer (e.g. http://192.168.1.11:8080/example/index.html)\nRunning and debugging the tests\nnpm test\n\nWhen you run the tests a 'coverage' directory will be created. Note that this directory does not exist in the main repository, since it is solely a build artifact. If you open the HTML file under  'coverage/html/index.html' with a web browser (no HTTP server is required), you will be able to view and examine the test coverage report.\n\nOnce you have started the tests, you can also navigate to http://0.0.0.0:9876/debug within a web browser to debug the tests through the Karma test runner. Note that this URL does not work immediately, since the first step in npm test is to rebuild the library.\nRunning code linting\nnpm run eslint\n\n# Or include automatic fixing with:\nnpm run eslint-fix\n\n# Or automatically fix 'test' directory with:\nnpm run eslint-fix-test\n\nRunning the commands above will check the source code for linting issues.\nSubmitting changes through Pull Requests\nIf you have made a source code change that you think should be included in the main repository, you can contribute it back to the community by creating a Pull Request. Please create an associated Issue to describe the problem you are solving / feature you are adding so the library maintainers can give you feedback on whether or not these changes are appropriate for the repository. It's possible that your bug fix / new feature would be better implemented in another library (e.g. Cornerstone Tools). Please ensure that all tests pass and you have run ESLint and fixed any issues before submitting a pull request.\nDevelopment Toolchain and Specifications\nCornerstone relies on a number of open source tools, components, and free services to ensure quality and stability. We want to ensure developers can work in modern JavaScript and that end users can use the tools in both current and legacy environments.\nGeneral\n\nBabel for transpilation from next generation JavaScript to more widely supported previous JavaScript versions.\nWebPack to bundle the project\nESLint is used to enforce code styling and maintain quality\nNPM is used to host the installable package. See Cornerstone Core on NPM\nSemantic Versioning is used for versioning of the library.\nkeep a changelog is used for the formatting of the changelog.\n\nTesting\n\nKarma is used as a test runner\nMocha is used as a test framework\nChai is used for test assertions\nIstanbul is used to report code coverage\nTravis CI is used to automatically run tests. See Cornerstone Core on Travis CI\nCoveralls is used to display code coverage following automatic tests. See Cornerstone Core Coveralls Test Coverage\nHeadless Chrome is used for running headless tests.\n\nDocumentation\n\nJSDoc formatting is used for documenting the source code.\ndocumentation.js generates API documentation in Markdown from JSDoc annotations\nGitBook transforms the Markdown documentation into HTML\nGithub Pages hosts the documentation\nCloudflare is placed in front of Github Pages to serve the documentation over HTTPS.\nRawgit is used to serve Live Examples from the repository. We should transition this to be hosted with Github Pages as well.\n\nWriting tests\nHere are some general notes on writing tests which may be useful:\n\nTests must be in the 'test' directory. Please try to ensure they follow the 'src' directory layout for simplicity.\nTest file names must end in \"_test.js\"\nThe 'coverage_test.js' file ensures that all files are considered by Istanbul, so that code coverage reports can be used to explore the whole repository.\nDo not convert 'function ()' to arrow functions (i.e. '=> {}') within the 'it', 'should', or 'describe' blocks or Mocha will fail to run the tests properly.\n\nReleasing a new version\n\nMake sure you have the latest commits from master\nDetermine the version change you need to make based on the scope of the changes since the last release.\nUpdate the changelog\nMake sure to thank any code contributors!\n\n\nUpdate the package and dependency versions in \"package.json\"\nUpdate the build version:npm run version\n\n\nRun the build:npm run build\n\n\nCommit the changesgit commit -am \"Bump version \"\n\n\nTag the commits with the version number and titlegit tag -a \"\" -m \"Version \"\n\n\nPush the commit with the version number to mastergit push origin master --tags\n\n\nPublish the release to NPM:npm publish\n\n\n\nUpdating Docs with gitbook\nIf its your first time:\n\nMake sure you have gitbook-cli installed globally, if not, run:npm install -g gitbook-cli\n\n\nGo inside the /docs folder and do:gitbook install\n\n\n\nUpdating files and deploying\n\nOn the root folder run:npm run docs\n# It will serve the documentation on http://localhost:4000/\n# with livereload\n\n\nChange the docs needed and make sure everything is correct\nIn order to deploy, run: npm run docs:deploy\n\n\n\n"}}}
